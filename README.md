👋 Hi, I’m @akshaykhaire
👀 I’m interested in building modern web applications, architecting scalable frontend systems, and exploring full-stack development with a focus on performance and clean code. 
🌱 I’m currently learning RC-19 , Next 15 & advanced system design for e-commerce platforms accelerator and AI integration into web platforms. 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source frontend projects, e-commerce platforms, and anything that pushes the limits of JavaScript, React, or Next.js.

⚡ Fun fact: I love trekking and travel photography — if I’m not coding, I’m probably exploring a new trail or capturing sunsets!
